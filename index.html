        <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Tea consumption has its legendary origins in China of more than 4,000 years ago.[9] Green tea was first brewed in 2737 BC during the reign of Emperor Chen Nung (or Shennong, in pinyin transliteration).[10] Green tea has been used as both a beverage and a medicine in most of Asia, including China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, and Vietnam, to help everything from controlling bleeding and helping heal wounds to regulating body temperature, blood sugar and promoting digestion.

	<h2>Steeping</h2>
    
    <p>Steeping is the process of making a cup of tea; it is also referred to as brewing. In general, two grams of tea per 100 ml of water, or about one teaspoon of green tea per five ounce cup, should be used. With very high-quality teas like gyokuro, more than this amount of leaf is used, and the leaf is steeped multiple times for short durations.Green tea steeping time and temperature varies with different tea.

    <h2>So What's the Best?</h2>
    
    <p>Types of tea are commonly graded depending on the quality and the parts of the plant used as well as how they are processed.There are large variations in both price and quality within these broad categories, and there are many specialty green teas that fall outside this spectrum. The best Japanese green tea is said to be that from the Yame region of Fukuoka Prefecture and the Uji region of Kyoto.
